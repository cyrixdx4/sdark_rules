WHAT IS
SHADOWDARK?
Shadowdark RPG is a fantasy
adventure game where you
and your companions delve
into buried ruins, lost cities,
spider-infested forests, and even
fearsome dragon lairs in search
of gold and glory.
The Shadowdark is any place
where danger and darkness hold
sway. It clutches ancient secrets
and dusty treasures in its rotting
claws, daring fortune seekers to
tempt their fates.
With your adventuring
companions at your side, you
confront the Shadowdark's
sinister traps, formidable magics,
and ruthless monsters.
If you survive, you'll bring back
untold riches plucked from
the jaws of death itself. And
before long, you'll hear the
Shadowdark's call once again!

WHAT DEFINES THIS
GAME?
Speed, danger, and simplicity.
Magic is perilous, and battles are
fast and deadly. Being clever is
crucial for survival.
Shadowdark RPG is rules-light
and intuitive. It encourages
quick decisions rather than
hunting through the rulebook
for answers.
In this game, a torch only holds
back the pressing darkness for
one hour of real-world time.
There isn’t a moment to waste
when the flames are burning
low...

HOW DO I PLAY?
Everything you need to get
started playing is in this tome.
Turn to the next section to get
familiar with the basics!
7

The Basics
If this is your first time playing
Shadowdark RPG, it’s helpful to
start with a premade character.
Several adventurers are included
with this book.
These quickstart rules cover
beginner characters for their
first few adventures. The full
rules go much further; check
them out at thearcanelibrary.
com/pages/shadowdark.

CHARACTERS

DESCRIBE AN
ACTION
On your turn, describe an action
you want to do. For example, you
could say you’re going to shoot
your bow at a troll.
The GM might ask you to make a
check (see Checks) to determine
whether your action succeeds.

MOVEMENT

You decide your character’s
actions and tell them to the
referee, or Game Master (GM).

During your turn, you can move
up to near (roughly 30 feet). You
can break this movement up
in any way. If you don’t take an
action, you can move near again.

The GM determines if your
actions are successful and
describes the results.

ROUNDS

This back-and-forth between
you, the GM, and your
adventuring companions grows
and shapes the game world.
Always ask yourself: If you were
really your character, what
would you do right now?
8

Each person takes a turn,
starting with the GM and going
clockwise. The GM controls the
monsters and environment and
narrates how everyone’s actions
change the game world.
Once everyone has taken a turn,
that completes one round. Then,
a new round begins.

THE DICE

CHECKS

You'll need a four-sided (d4), sixsided (d6), eight-sided (d8), tensided (d10), twelve-sided (d12)
and twenty-sided (d20) die.

When attempting a risky action,
roll a d20 and add a modifier.
That’s called making a check.

Multiples. 3d6 = three six-sided
dice. Roll them together and add
them.
Advantage. Roll two times and
use the higher result.

The GM chooses the check's
linked stat and a number called
a difficulty class (DC). If the total
of your d20 roll + stat modifier
equals or beats the DC, your
action succeeds.

Disadvantage. Roll two times
and use the lower result.

For example, the GM might say
leaping over a narrow chasm
requires a DC 12 Strength check.

STATS

HIT POINTS

Stats are your characteristics.
Each stat goes from 3-18 and
has a bonus or penalty (called a
modifier, or MOD) from -4 to +4.

Injuries cause you to take
damage and lose hit points
(HP). Typical weapons deal 1d6
damage to your HP. You regain
lost HP after a night of rest.

Strength. Physical power.
Dexterity. Agility, reflexes.
Constitution. Endurance,
resistance to injury.
Intelligence. Logical ability.
Wisdom. Instinct, willpower.
Charisma. Appeal, presence.

Characters at zero HP die in
1d4 + Constitution modifier
(minimum 1) rounds. Dead
characters are retired from play!

WHAT’S NEXT?
You could play a whole game
with just the basics. But once
you're ready for more, the next
chapters expand upon them.

Characters

Both the wise and foolish risk their fortunes in the
Shadowdark. The darkness decides who is who.

11

Overview
To make a Shadowdark RPG
character (also called a player
character, or PC), grab your dice,
a blank character sheet, and go
through the next few pages. You
can also view a walkthrough at
youtube.com/thearcanelibrary.

Choose a worthy name for your
adventurer.

ANCESTRY
Your character’s cultural and
ancestral heritage.

CLASS
Your character’s job.

LEVEL

gain levels by earning XP.

on the treasure and boons you
earn from adventuring.
12

ALIGNMENT & DEITY
Your character’s cosmic link to
the opposing forces of Law and

STATS

from weapons, traps, spells,
or other sources temporarily
reduces your HP. You can regain
HP by resting.

AC

GEAR

Armor class (AC) is a type of
difficulty class that shows how
tough it is to injure you, whether
because you're agile or you wear
armor. Your class determines the
type of armor you can wear.

Your equipment. You can carry
a number of items equal to 10 or
your Strength stat, whichever is
higher.

Your AC starts at 10 + your
Dexterity modifier. Wearing
armor changes your AC (see
Armor, pg. 34).

ATTACKS
The weapons you wield and
how you use them to fight an
enemy (see Combat on pg. 50
for details). You can wield the
weapons listed for your class.

heroes who are ready to go on
dangerous adventures.

•	 Background, pg. 14
•	 Stats, pg. 15
•	 Choice of ancestry, pg. 16
•	 Choice of class, start pg. 20

+ their Constitution modifier
(minimum 1)

SPELLS
Some classes can learn and cast

on pg. 52 for more details).

Alignment
Alignment defines your role in
the clash between good and
evil. All creatures are connected
to the eternal conflict waged
by Law, Chaos, and Neutrality,
whether they know it or not.

Law is benevolence, Chaos is
malevolence, and Neutrality is
impartial, favoring neither.
Choose one of the following
three alignments.

CHAOTIC
Chaotic characters align
themselves with destruction,
ambition, and wickedness.
Chaotic characters adopt a
“survival of the fittest” mentality.

LAWFUL
Lawful characters align
themselves with fairness, order,
and virtue. Lawful characters
operate from a “good of the
whole” mentality.

NEUTRAL
Neutral characters find balance
between Law and Chaos. They
align with the cycle of growth
and decline, adopting a “nature
must take its course” mentality.

Deities
The many gods of the universe
are the personifications of Law,
Chaos, and Neutrality.
The most well-known gods are
listed here. A character may
worship any deity, or none.
Priests must choose one god
to serve faithfully. A priest's
deity can revoke the gift
of spellcasting if the priest
commits blasphemous acts.
Most folk worship one of The
Four Lords, the lawful and
neutral gods who stand for
justice, order, and mercy.
Malevolent beings worship one
of The Dark Trio, chaotic deities
who evince power, destruction,
and cruelty.
There were once nine primary
gods, but two are The Lost,
forbidden or forgotten. Many folk
still refer to The Nine in the oaths
they swear, and ancient stories
always begin with, "Beneath the
Eyes of The Nine..."
30

SAINT TERRAGNIS
(LAWFUL)
A legendary knight who is the
patron of most lawful humans.
She ascended to godhood long
ago and is the embodiment of
righteousness and justice.

GEDE (NEUTRAL)
The god of feasts, mirth, and the
wilds. Gede is usually peaceful,
but primal storms rage when
her anger rises. Many elves and
halflings worship her.

MADEERA THE
COVENANT (LAWFUL)
Madeera was the first
manifestation of Law. She carries
every law of reality, a dictate
called the Covenant, written on
her skin in precise symbols.

ORD (NEUTRAL)
Ord the Unbending, the Wise,
the Secret-Keeper. He is the god
of magic, knowledge, secrets,
and equilibrium.

MEMNON (CHAOTIC)
Memnon was the first
manifestation of Chaos. He is
Madeera’s twin, a red-maned,
leonine being whose ultimate
ambition is to rend the cosmic
laws of the Covenant from his
sister’s skin.

SHUNE THE VILE
(CHAOTIC)
Shune whispers arcane secrets
to sorcerers and witches who
call to her in the dark hours.
She schemes to displace Ord so
she can control the vast flow of
magic herself.

RAMLAAT (CHAOTIC)

THE LOST (?)

Ramlaat is the Pillager, the
Barbaric, the Horde. Many orcs
worship him and live by the
Blood Rite, a prophecy that says
only the strongest will survive a
coming doom.

Two of The Nine are lost to the
ages, their names expunged
from history and memory. Yet
their whispered legend lingers
on in ancient, forbidden texts
and secret, deep places...

Gameplay

The Shadowdark is like a sleeping bear. Only go near
it if you have a 10-foot pole and are prepared to die.

39

Rolling the Dice
ADVANTAGE

CANCELING

When you have advantage on a
roll, it means you're in a strong
position to succeed.

If you have both advantage and
disadvantage on a roll, they
cancel each other out.

For example, you might be
attacking from the high ground,
or you might have just failed at
a task and now have insight into
how to succeed if you try again.

NATURAL 20

To roll with advantage, roll the
same die twice and use the
better result.

DISADVANTAGE
When you have disadvantage on
a roll, it means you're in a strong
position to fail.
For example, you might be
trying to strike an enemy while
blinded by sand, or navigating
a maze while confused by
disorienting poison.
To roll with disadvantage, roll
the same die twice and use the
worse result.

40

When a d20 die roll shows a 20,
what you're doing succeeds to
your maximum capacity. An
attack roll automatically hits and
is a critical hit (see Damage on
pg. 51).

NATURAL 1
When a d20 die roll shows a 1,
what you're doing fails to your
maximum capacity. An attack
roll automatically misses and
might even strike an ally.

THE D6 DECIDER
If there's a random chance for
an outcome, such as whether a
dropped torch goes out, the GM
calls for a d6 roll. A 1-3 results
in the worse outcome for the
players, and a 4-6 results in the
better one.

Luck Tokens
Sometimes the GM awards
a luck token to a player for
exceptional roleplaying, heroism,
or just plain coolness.
Each player can only have one
luck token at a time.
You can cash in a luck token to
reroll any roll you just made. You
must use the new result.
You can also give your luck
token to a companion.

HOW MANY TO GIVE?
The GM might award 3-5 luck
tokens per player during a
session with a pulpy, heroic feel.
Alternatively, the GM might only
give out 1 luck token per player
during a game session that is
grim, difficult, and dark.
Big sacrifices, moving speeches,
or incredibly daring maneuvers
might be worthy of a luck token,
whether or not the character's
action was successful.
41

Using Stats
Certain tasks fall under specific
stats. The following examples
illustrate common uses for each
one.
The difference between
Intelligence and Wisdom can
be tricky. If in doubt, remember
Wisdom is for sensory acuity
and instinct, while Intelligence
covers knowledge and logic.

STRENGTH
•	 Smashing open locked doors
•	 Bending the bars of a prison
cell or sewer grate
•	 Lifting a large rock overhead
•	 Stopping a runaway ship's
helm from spinning

DEXTERITY
•	 Diving away from a trap that
flings a hail of needles
•	 Disabling a tripwire without
activating it

CONSTITUTION
•	 Holding your breath
underwater
•	 Withstanding intense pain
•	 Resisting the effects of poison

INTELLIGENCE
•	 Giving first aid to a dying
character
•	 Recalling the path through a
twisting maze
•	 Finding food and water
sources in the wilderness

WISDOM
•	 Spotting a well-hidden enemy
•	 Determining the direction of
a faint noise or smell
•	 Deciphering the sounds on
the other side of a door

CHARISMA
•	 Performing ventriloquism

•	 Scaling a sheer castle wall

•	 Applying a disguise

•	 Fooling onlookers with sleight
of hand tricks

•	 Rallying allies who are
terrified by a monster

42

Making Checks
WHEN TO ROLL?

DIFFICULTY CLASS

Usually, you succeed at what
you're trained to do without
needing to roll a check.

The four standard DCs represent
how difficult an action is.

For example, a wizard is always
able to read magical runes, and
a thief always finds a trap if
searching in the right area.
If you take the time to scan the
sky for threats or examine a
stretch of wall for a secret door,
you simply succeed.

Easy, DC 9. Leaping a narrow
chasm, sneaking up on an
inattentive guard.
Normal, DC 12. Kicking open a
stuck door, picking a poor lock.
Hard, DC 15. Swimming against
a strong current, giving first aid
to stop a character from dying.

Social encounters usually rely
on what you say rather than
Charisma checks. Narrating a
moving speech or using secret

Extreme, DC 18. Climbing
a slippery cliff one-handed,
restraining a frenzied lion.

information you gathered to
influence an NPC does not
require a check to succeed.

OPPOSED CHECKS

The GM asks for a check when
the following is true:
•	 The action has a negative
consequence for failure
•	 The action requires skill
•	 There is time pressure

If multiple creatures are
working against each other on
a conflicting task, an opposed
check decides who succeeds.
To make an opposed check, each
participant rolls one relevant stat
check at the same time, even if
it's not their turn. The highest
result wins (reroll ties).
43

Time
REAL TIME

TIME PASSES

Time passes in the game world
at the same pace it's passing in
the real world. One minute or
hour of game time is equal to
one minute or hour in real time.

Every moment in the game
doesn't have to be accounted for
in real time.

This matters for tracking light
sources, because most light
sources only last for one hour of
real time.
If you can't track real time in
your game, assume one hour is
equal to 10 rounds.

TURNS AND ROUNDS
A turn is a player's moment to
describe what their character
does to the GM. Players act one
by one on each of their turns.
Some turns need a bit of room
to breathe. A character who
is speaking with someone
can make a few reasonable
exchanges back and forth.
A round completes when each
person has taken one turn.
44

For example, if the characters
want to spend 10 minutes
examining a room from top to
bottom, the GM and players can
agree that time passes.
When time passes, the GM and
players move any timers down
by that amount.
Minutes Pass. Effects with a
duration of rounds expire. The
GM rolls one random encounter
check that occurs on a 1-3 on a
d6 while this time is passing.
Hours/Days Pass. Effects with a
duration shorter than the time
passed expire. The GM uses
overland travel rules to check for
encounters (see Game Master
Quickstart Guide, pg. 14).
After resolving encounters, the
game world fast-forwards to the
new point in time.

Turn Order
INITIATIVE

GM TURN

Shadowdark RPG is played in
turn order right from the start.

1. The GM counts down any
timers not tracked by players.

At the beginning of the game,
the GM establishes initiative, or
the order in which the players
act. Everyone rolls a d20 and
adds their DEX modifier. The GM
adds the highest DEX modifier
of any monsters, if relevant.

2. The GM checks for a random
encounter, if needed.

The person who rolled the
highest takes the first turn, and
the turn order moves clockwise
from that individual.

4. The GM describes what the
characters notice as a result of
steps 1-3.

PLAYER TURN
1. The player counts down any
personal timers for spells and
other effects.
2. The player takes an action and
may move up to near (split up in
any way). The player can move
near again if skipping an action.
3. The GM describes what
happens as a result of the
player's turn.

3. The GM takes actions
and makes movements for
any relevant creatures or
environmental effects.

ENCOUNTERS
An encounter occurs when a
challenge presents itself that
stops the characters' progress.
An encounter could include a
monster charging out of the
darkness, a sinkhole breaking
open in the ground, or a town
guard halting the characters.
The GM rolls for the chance of
an encounter every few rounds
depending on how dangerous
the characters' environment is.
45

Crawling
Characters are in crawling
rounds while not in combat.

THE SHADOWDARK
The Shadowdark is any place
where darkness, danger, and
myth reign supreme.
It could be among the
crumbling ruins buried inside a
forgotten mountain stronghold.
It could be within the
spellwrought castle of an
undead sorcerer who probes the
universe for arcane secrets.
It could be beneath the
cursed trees where squirming
abominations boil out of a black
pit, pulping all in their path.

VISION
All characters need light to
see, but that's not true for the
darkness-adapted beings of the
Shadowdark.
Any area outside the characters'
light sources is in total darkness.
46

LIGHT SOURCES
Most light sources last for up
to an hour of real time and
illuminate a limited area.
New light sources lit while
another is already active "ride
along" on the current timer.
That said, the GM should use
their best discretion and avoid
being punitive; if there isn't
much time left on the current
timer and the characters light a
new torch, snuff out all old light
sources and start a new timer.
There should only be one active
light timer except in rare cases.

TOTAL DARKNESS
While in total darkness, a
creature who is not darknessadapted has disadvantage on
most tasks it tries to undertake,
as determined by the GM.
Also, the environment becomes
deadly. Check for a random
encounter every crawling round.

MOVEMENT

CONDITIONS

Distances. Distances are broken
up into close (5 feet), near (up
to 30 feet), and far (within sight
during an encounter or scene).

Some effects impose a condition
on a character, such as blindness
from a blast of fungal spores
or the inability to move while
tangled in a giant spider web.

Climbing. Strength or Dexterity
check to climb half your speed.
Fall if you fail by 5+ points.
Falling. You take 1d6 damage for
every 10 feet you fall.
Moving Through. You can move
freely through allies. You must
pass a Strength or Dexterity
check to move through enemies.
Swimming. Make a Strength
check to swim half your speed
or a Constitution check to hold
your breath. If you fail, you take
1d6 damage each round until
you exit the hazard.

REGROUP
During crawling rounds, the GM
can ask the players if they want
to regroup. To regroup, any PCs
within eyesight or earshot of
each other who are able to move
freely may immediately move
within near of each other. Then,
initiative continues as normal.

Advantage and disadvantage
apply to most situations, as does
common sense.
For example, a blinded character
has disadvantage on tasks
requiring sight, and a character
stuck in a giant spider web can't
move until freed.

ACTIONS
While crawling, characters can
take actions that might include:
•	 Prying a gem from a statue
•	 Sneaking up on a slumbering
manticore
•	 Swimming to the bottom of
an oily pool of water
•	 Tapping on a suspicious wall
to check for a hidden door
•	 Scanning a room for signs of
hidden enemies
•	 Giving a rousing speech to a
group of fearful townsfolk
47

Resting
RESTING

DANGER LEVEL

Injured characters can rest to
recover from their wounds. To
rest, a character must consume
a ration and sleep for 8 hours.

Characters can rest anywhere,
but doing so inside a dungeon
or perilous environment carries a
high chance of failure due to the
risk of a random encounter.

Sleep can be broken up for light
and routine tasks, such as taking
a turn on watch.
Interruption. Each stressful
interruption of rest (including
combat) requires an affected
character to make a DC 12
Constitution check.

While the characters are resting
in a dangerous environment, the
Game Master checks for random
encounters using the overland
travel cadence:
Unsafe. Check every 3 hours.
Risky. Check every 2 hours.

On a failure, the character
consumes a ration but gains no
benefit from resting.
Success. A character who
successfully rests regains all
lost hit points and recovers
any stat damage that was not
permanent.
Additionally, some talents, spells,
or items regain their ability to be
used after a successful rest.

48

Deadly. Check every hour.

CAMPFIRE
In many cases, adventurers need
a light source while resting.
Characters can combine three
torches into a campfire that
can't be moved once lit.
A campfire lasts up to 8 hours
while at least one character
remains near to it, and it casts
light out to a near distance.

Stealth and Surprise
HIDING AND
SNEAKING
Creatures who are hiding
or sneaking must succeed
on Dexterity checks to go
undetected by other creatures
within eyesight or earshot.
The GM determines the
frequency and difficulty
of the check based on the
environment.
The GM might secretly roll
the check for a character if
knowledge of the outcome
impacts the situation.
Hiding Limitations. Creatures
can't hide while other creatures
are able to see them, even at a
casual glance.
It might also be impossible to
hide if there's nowhere for a
creature to stay out of sight.

DETECTING
Detecting a hiding or sneaking
creature requires the searcher to
actively look or listen.
Looking in the right place
automatically reveals a hidden
creature. Otherwise, the
searcher must succeed on a
Wisdom check to perceive a
hiding or sneaking creature.

SURPRISE
A creature who begins its turn
undetected has the advantage
of surprise. If combat hasn't
started yet, those with surprise
take one turn before the combat
initiative roll (see Combat
Initiative! on pg. 50).
A creature has advantage on
attack rolls against surprised
targets.
Attacking from hiding gives
away the attacker's position
afterwards unless the GM
determines otherwise.
49

Combat
When a fight breaks out,
combat rounds begin!

DETERMINE
SURPRISE
The GM determines if any
creatures are unaware of each
other. A creature who surprises
another takes one turn before a
new initiative order is rolled.

COMBAT INITIATIVE!
After surprise turns, the GM
calls for new initiative. Everyone
makes a Dexterity check (the
GM uses the highest Dexterity
modifier of any monsters).
The person with the highest
result takes the first turn. Turns
go clockwise from that person.

COMBAT TURNS
Characters can take one action
and move near on their turn,
splitting up the movement
however they want. Characters
can move near again if they
don't take an action.
50

ACTIONS
Melee Attack. Melee attacks
use melee weapons. Roll 1d20 +
your Strength modifier + talent
bonuses. You hit the target if
your total is equal to or greater
than its AC.
Ranged Attack. Ranged attacks
use ranged weapons. Roll 1d20 +
your Dexterity modifier + talent
bonuses. You hit the target if
your total is equal to or greater
than its AC.
Cast A Spell. Casting a
spell takes one action (see
Spellcasting on pg. 52).
Improvise. Do an improvised
action, such as swinging across
a ravine on a vine. The GM might
determine it requires a check or
attack roll.
Multitask. Characters can do
small, parallel tasks on their
turns, such as standing up,
speaking, activating a magic
item, or quaffing a potion. This
doesn't typically use their action.

DAMAGE

MORALE

When you hit a target with an
attack or spell, you damage
it. Roll your weapon or spell's
damage dice + talent bonuses.
The GM subtracts that amount
from the target's hit points.

Enemies who are reduced to
half their ranks (or half their HP
for a solo enemy) flee if they
fail a DC 15 Wisdom check. For
large groups, the GM makes one
check with the leader's modifier.

Knockout. You can choose to
knock a creature unconscious
instead of killing it if you reduce
it to 0 hit points.

DEATH

Critical Hit. You deal a critical
hit if you roll a natural 20 on an
attack roll or spellcasting check.
For a weapon, double its
damage dice on the attack. For a
spell, you may double one of its
numerical effects (see pg. 53).

TERRAIN
Attacking or casting a spell on
a creature that is hiding at least
half its body behind interposing
terrain has disadvantage. If you
can't see a creature at all due to
terrain, you can't target it.
Creatures can only move half the
normal distance through terrain
that hampers free movement,
such as ice or deep mud.

A character who goes to 0 HP
falls unconscious and is dying. A
character who goes above 0 HP
wakes up and is no longer dying.
Death Timer. A dying character
rolls 1d4 + their CON modifier
(minimum 1 total) on their turn.
They die in that many rounds
unless healed or stabilized.
On each of the character's
subsequent turns, that player
rolls a d20. On a natural 20, the
character rises with 1 hit point.
Stabilize. An intelligent being
can give first aid to a dying
creature at close range. On a
successful DC 15 Intelligence
check, the target stops dying
(but is still unconscious).
Death. A character who perishes
is retired from the game.
51

Casting Spells
Spellcasters use the raw power
of creation and destruction to
bend reality, shaping it to the
will of their gods or ambitions.
Wizard magic is fickle,
complicated, and volatile. Even
the most learned mages tread
carefully when reaching beyond
the veil to grasp arcane energies.
Priest magic is miraculous,
sacred, and instinctive. Priests
who offend their gods might
lose the ability to cast spells until
they can undertake penance.

CASTING
When you cast a spell, you
invoke magic to cause an effect.
Casting a spell takes your action.
Characters with the spellcasting
talent can cast spells.
To cast a wizard spell you know,
make a spellcasting check by
rolling 1d20 + your Intelligence
modifier.
To cast a priest spell you know,
make a spellcasting check by
rolling 1d20 + your Wisdom
modifier.
The DC to successfully cast a
spell is 10 + the spell’s tier.

RESULTS
If you succeed on your
spellcasting check, the spell
takes effect.
If you fail your spellcasting
check, the spell does not take
effect. You can’t cast that spell
again until you complete a rest.
52

CRITICAL SUCCESS

PENANCE

If you roll a natural 20 on
your spellcasting check, you
may double one of the spell’s
numerical effects. This remains
in effect on a focus spell (see
pg. 56) until your next focus
check.

The GM determines the exact
nature of the penance you must
undertake based on your deity
and alignment.

CRITICAL FAILURE
If you roll a natural 1 on your
spellcasting check, the spell
does not take effect. If it
was a focus spell, the spell
immediately ends (see pg. 56
for more details on focus spells).
Wizard Spell. If the spell was a
wizard spell, you can’t cast that
spell again until you successfully
complete a rest. You must also
roll on the Wizard Mishap table
corresponding to the spell’s tier
(see pg. 54).

Penance requires a holy
quest, ritualistic atonement,
or a material sacrifice that you
donate or destroy.
Inadequate or subversive
penance (such as donating your
sacrifice to a party member) only
displeases your deity further and
makes the spell loss permanent.

Priest Spell. If the spell was

its power. You can’t cast that

and successfully complete a rest.

Scrolls and Wands
USING SCROLLS AND
WANDS
Scrolls and wands contain magic
spells. Spellcasters can use them
to cast these spells if the spell
is on their spell list (even if they
don't know the spell).
To do so, they must succeed
on a spellcasting check with a
DC of 10 + the tier of the spell
contained in the wand or scroll.
Treat this the same as normal
spellcasting with the following
additions.

SCROLLS
After a successful or failed
casting attempt, the magical
writing disappears from the
scroll and it ceases to work.

WANDS
On a failed casting attempt, the
wand stops functioning until you
complete a rest.
On a critical failure, the wand
breaks and permanently ceases
to work. The spellcaster incurs a
mishap or penance as usual.

55

Spell Attributes
TIERS

FOCUS

Spells are classified according to
their tiers, which range from 1-5.

Some spells last for as long as
you focus. You can’t cast other
focus spells while focusing. You
can end a focus spell at any
time.

RANGE
Range determines at what
distance (close, near, or far) you
can deliver the spell’s effects.
Self range means you can only
target yourself with the spell.

DURATION
Duration is how long the spell
effects last. Spells can have an
instant effect or last for several
turns, rounds, or longer. See
Focus for spells with a focus
duration.

OVERLAPPING
EFFECTS
Ongoing effects of the same
spell on the same target do
not combine. The spell with
the most powerful effect takes
precedence, such as the spell
with the longer remaining
duration.
56

To maintain focus, make a
spellcasting check at the start of
your turn as if you were casting
that spell.
Success. The spell remains in
effect until the start of your next
turn.
Failure. The spell ends. If you
were focusing, you do not lose
the ability to cast that spell.
However, if you critically fail on a
check to maintain focus, treat it
as a standard critical failure (see
pg. 53 for details on criticals).
If you take damage or become
distracted while focusing (due
to an earthquake, for example),
you must immediately make a
spellcasting check to maintain
focus.
